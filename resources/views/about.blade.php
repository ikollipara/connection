                    AIR@NE was a NSF-funded grant that examined the adaptation and implementation of a validated K-8
                    Computer Science curriculum in diverse school districts. The grant expanded the
                    Research-Practitioner Partnership between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Lincoln Public
                    Schools (LPS) to other districts across Nebraska. <br><br>The primary goal was to study how
                    districts facing different contextual challenges, including rural schools, majority-minority
                    schools, and Native American reservation schools, adapt the curriculum to fit local needs and
                    strengths to broaden participation in computer science.

                    AIR@NE connected teachers across the state of Nebraska, from the panhandle to Omaha and Lincoln.
                    This statewide community helped connect CS teachers to other CS teachers. It created a place to
                    learn and grow that wasn't bound by distance. <br><br>As more states add CS to their standards, we
                    realized there might be a spot for an online PLC, centered around CS.
